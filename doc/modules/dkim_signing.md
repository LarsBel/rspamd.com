# DKIM signing module

The DKIM signing module has been added in Rspamd 1.5 to provide a relatively simple way to configure DKIM signing, the more flexible alternative being [sign_condition]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/modules/dkim.html#dkim-signatures) in the DKIM module.

DKIM signing currently works with Milter based MTAs (Sendmail, Postfix), Haraka & Communigate. For DKIM signing to work, you must [scan outbound mail with rspamd]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/tutorials/scanning_outbound.html).

# Principles of operation

The DKIM signing module chooses signing domains and selectors according to a predefined policy which can be modified with various settings. Description of this policy follows:

 * To be eligible for signing, a mail must be received from an authenticated user OR a reserved IP address OR an address in the `sign_networks` map (if defined)
 * If envelope from address is not empty, the effective second level domain must match the MIME header From
 * If authenticated user is present, this should be suffixed with @domain where domain is what's seen is envelope/header From address
 * Selector and path to key are selected from domain-specific config if present, falling back to global config

# Configuration

~~~ucl
# local.d/dkim_signing.conf

# If false, messages with empty envelope from are not signed
allow_envfrom_empty = true;

# If true, envelope/header domain mismatch is ignored
allow_hdrfrom_mismatch = false;

# If true, multiple from headers are allowed (but only first is used)
allow_hdrfrom_multiple = false;

# If true, username does not need to contain matching domain
allow_username_mismatch = false;

# If false, messages from authenticated users are not selected for signing
auth_only = true;

# Default path to key, can include '$domain' and '$selector' variables
path = "/var/lib/rspamd/dkim/$domain.$selector.key";

# Default selector to use
selector = "dkim";

# If false, messages from local networks are not selected for signing
sign_local = true;

# Map file of IP addresses/subnets to consider for signing
# sign_networks = "/some/file"; # or url

# Symbol to add when message is signed
symbol = "DKIM_SIGNED";

# Whether to fallback to global config
try_fallback = true;

# Domain to use for DKIM signing: can be "header" (MIME From), "envelope" (SMTP From) or "auth" (SMTP username)
use_domain = "header";

# Domain to use for DKIM signing when sender is in sign_networks ("header"/"envelope"/"auth")
#use_domain_sign_networks = "header";

# Domain to use for DKIM signing when sender is a local IP ("header"/"envelope"/"auth")
#use_domain_sign_local = "header";

# Whether to normalise domains to eSLD
use_esld = true;

# Whether to get keys from Redis
use_redis = false;

# Hash for DKIM keys in Redis
key_prefix = "DKIM_KEYS";

# map of domains -> names of selectors (since rspamd 1.5.3)
#selector_map = "/etc/rspamd/dkim_selectors.map";

# map of domains -> paths to keys (since rspamd 1.5.3)
#path_map = "/etc/rspamd/dkim_paths.map";

# Domain specific settings
domain {

  # Domain name is used as key
  example.com {

    # Private key path
    path = "/var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.key";

    # Selector
    selector = "ds";

  }

}

## DKIM keys in Redis

To use DKIM keys stored in Redis you should add the following to configuration:

~~~ucl
# local.d/dkim_signing.conf
use_redis = true;
key_prefix = "DKIM_KEYS";
selector = "myselector";
~~~

... and populate the named hash with DKIM keys; for example the following Lua script could be run with `redis-cli --eval`:

~~~lua
local key = [[-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

redis.call('HMSET', 'DKIM_KEYS', 'myselector.example.com', key)
~~~

The selector will be chosen as per usual (a domain-specific selector will be used if configured, otherwise the global setting is used).

## Using maps

Since Rspamd 1.5.3 one or both of `selector_map` or `path_map` can be used to look up selectors and paths to private keys respectively (using the DKIM signing domain as the key). If entries are found, these will override default settings.

In the following configuration we define a templatised path for the DKIM signing key, a default selector, and a map which could be used for overriding the default selector (and hence effective path to the signing key as well). Any eligible mail will be signed given there is a suitably-named key on disk.

~~~ucl
# local.d/dkim_signing.conf
try_fallback = true;
path = "/var/lib/rspamd/dkim/$domain.$selector.key";
selector_map = "/etc/rspamd/dkim_selectors.map";
selector = "dkim";
~~~

In the following configuration, we attempt to sign only domains which are present in both `selector_map` and `path_map`:

~~~ucl
# local.d/dkim_signing.conf
try_fallback = false;
selector_map = "/etc/rspamd/dkim_selectors.map";
path_map = "/etc/rspamd/dkim_paths.map";
~~~

Format of the maps should be as shown:

~~~
$ head -1 /etc/rspamd/dkim_selectors.map
example.net dkim
$ head -1 /etc/rspamd/dkim_paths.map
example.net /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.net.$selector.key
~~~
