# Rspamd configuration

Rspamd uses the Universal Configuration Language (UCL) for its configuration. The UCL format is described in detail in this [document](ucl.html). Rspamd defines several variables and macros to extend
UCL functionality.

## UCL sections and includes

UCL implements JSON data model. However, there are a lot of mentions of the `sections` in Rspamd documentation. You can treat sections as a simple subobjects of the top object. For example, here are two equivalent definitions in `ucl config` and in `json` syntax:

```ucl
section "foo" {
    opt = 10;
}
```

vs

```json
{
    "section": {
        "foo": {
            "opt": 10
        }
    }
}
```

UCL also supports include directive and it is used extensively in Rspamd configuration. This directive allows to include other file (or files), to define override/merge strategy, to define new elements priority and do couple of other useful things. Priorities determine how values are overwritten during include. Higher priority elements overwrite lower priority ones. Normally, all Rspamd sections contain 2 or 3 includes:

* Dynamic configuration include (priority = 5) - used to redefine elements from WebUI (this include can be omitted in some cases)
* Override file (priority=10) - used to define static overrides (have the highest priority)
* Local file (priority=1, duplicate=merge) - used to add new configuration directives

Duplicate policy merge means that if there are two objects with the same name in both files, then their keys are merged:

```ucl
# fileA.conf
obj {
    key = 1;
    subobj {
        subkey = 2;
    }
}
.include(duplicate=merge,priority=1) "fileB.conf"

# fileB.conf
obj {
    key = 2;
    nkey = 1;
    subobj {
        subkey = 3;
        nsub = 1;
    }
}
```

will form the following configuration:

```ucl
obj {
    key = 2; # overriden from fileB
    nkey = 1; # added from fileB
    subobj {
        subkey = 3; # overriden from fileB
        nsub = 1; # added from fileB
    }
}
```

Typical section in Rspamd:

```ucl
section {
  default_key = "value";
  subsection {
      foo = "bar";
  }

  .include(try=true,priority=5) "${DBDIR}/dynamic/section.conf"
  .include(try=true,priority=1,duplicate=merge) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/local.d/section.conf"
  .include(try=true,priority=10) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/override.d/section.conf"
}
```

If you want to add or redefine some of those default values, you can use `local.d/section.conf` file:

```ucl
# local.d/section.conf
new_key = "new_value";
subsection {
    foo = "nobar";
}
```

Please mention that you **don't need** to add `section {}` in local.d/override.d files. It will break your configuration since include directives are already placed directly inside of the `section {}` block.

## Rspamd variables

Rspamd defines some of the useful variables to use in the configuration files (as "${VAR}"). These variables are simply replaced with substitution value. Nested variables (e.g. "${VAR1_${VAR2}}") are **NOT** supported.

- *CONFDIR*: configuration directory for Rspamd, found in `$PREFIX/etc/rspamd/`
- *LOCAL_CONFDIR*: site-local configuration directory for Rspamd, usually $CONFDIR
- *RUNDIR*: runtime directory to store pidfiles or UNIX sockets
- *DBDIR*: persistent databases directory (used for statistics or symbols cache).
- *LOGDIR*: a directory to store log files
- *PLUGINSDIR*: plugins directory for Lua plugins
- *RULESDIR*: directory in which rules are kept
- *PREFIX*: basic installation prefix
- *VERSION*: Rspamd version string (e.g. "0.6.6")
- *WWWDIR*: root directory for web interface

## Rspamd specific macros

- *.include_map*: defines a map that is dynamically reloaded and updated if its content has changed. This macro is intended to define dynamic configuration files.

## Rspamd basic configuration

The basic Rspamd configuration is stored in `$CONFDIR/rspamd.conf`. By default, this file looks like this one:

~~~ucl
.include "$CONFDIR/common.conf"

options {
    .include "$CONFDIR/options.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=1,duplicate=merge) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/local.d/options.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=10) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/override.d/options.inc"
}

logging {
    type = "console";
    systemd = true;
    .include "$CONFDIR/logging.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=1,duplicate=merge) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/local.d/logging.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=10) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/override.d/logging.inc"
}

worker {
    bind_socket = "*:11333";
    .include "$CONFDIR/worker-normal.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=1,duplicate=merge) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/local.d/worker-normal.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=10) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/override.d/worker-normal.inc"
}

worker {
    bind_socket = "localhost:11334";
    .include "$CONFDIR/worker-controller.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=1,duplicate=merge) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/local.d/worker-controller.inc"
    .include(try=true; priority=10) "$LOCAL_CONFDIR/override.d/worker-controller.inc"
}
~~~

In `common.conf`, we read a Lua script placed in `$RULESDIR/rspamd.lua` and load Lua rules from it. Then we include a global [options](options.html) section followed by [logging](logging.html) logging configuration. The [metrics.conf](metrics.html) file defines metric settings, including rule weights and Rspamd actions. The [workers](../workers/index.html) section specifies Rspamd workers settings. [Composites.conf](composites.html) describes composite symbols. Statistical filters are defined in [statistics.conf](statistic.html). Rspamd stores module configurations (for both Lua and internal modules) in  [modules.d](../modules/index.html) section while modules themselves are loaded from the following portion of `common.conf`:

~~~ucl
modules {
	path = "$PLUGINSDIR/lua/"
}
~~~

The modules section defines the path or paths of directories or specific files. If a directory is specified then all files with a `.lua` suffix are loaded as lua plugins (the directory path is treated as a `*.lua` shell pattern).

This configuration is not intended to be changed by the user, rather it should be overridden in site-specific configuration files- see the [quickstart]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/quickstart.html#configuring-rspamd) for details. Nevertheless, packaging will generally never overwrite configuration files on upgrade if they have been touched by the user. Please read the [migration notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/doc/migration.html) carefully if you upgrade Rspamd to a new version for all incompatible configuration changes.
